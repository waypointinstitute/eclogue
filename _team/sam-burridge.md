We were established in 2025 by our editor-in-chief, Sam Burridge, after multiple years of ideation and business planning.

Samâ€™s years as a marketing consultant and prior self-publishing experience have given us the tools and understanding we need to put your work in front of its best audience.

Our first publication as a press is still forthcoming. Look for it soon wherever books are sold!
